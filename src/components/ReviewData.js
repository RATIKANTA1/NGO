    review: "I am currently an intern in this organization and so far they have been accommodating with my queries and guided me throughout, the organization has allowed me to see the profound impact of well-executed marketing campaigns on driving engagement and support for important causes. Being someone from the Philippines I still feel really involved despite the geographical distance. Thank you so much Kshitiksha Foundation for accepting me as one of your interns!",

As a foundation they serve the community in many ways. I would suggest everyone to be a part of our family at least once to understand how good it feels to be a part of a change.",

    review: "One of the best places to work.  Kshitiksha Foundation gave me a much needed opportunity (in the form of an internship ) to me to contribute a little to the welfare of the society and I had a great time working with them..Apart from my experience,  I want to express a heartfelt thanks to my mentor during my internship Mr. DEEPAK KUMAR who is the director of the foundation himself. He not only explained and helped me through the internship but also is a very courteous person,  he solved all of my queries very politely..... Which made my work more convenient....",

    review: "I found Kshitiksha Foundation's internship on Internshala. Everything they did was well organised. At the beginning we were given an orientation session where each and every detail of the internship was given. We were given some tasks to complete on the basis of which we would be graded. These tasks helped a lot to improve our personalities on a large scale. I also overcame my fear towards animals because of a task which they gave. I would highly recommend this internship to everyone.",
